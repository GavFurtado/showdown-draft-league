       [1mscript [22m[options] [[4mfile[24m][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mscript [22mmakes a typescript of everything on your terminal session. The terminal data are stored in raw form to the log file and[m
       information about timing to another (optional) structured log file. The timing log file is necessary to replay the session[m
       later by [1mscriptreplay[22m(1) and to store additional information about the session.[m
[m
       Since version 2.35, [1mscript [22msupports multiple streams and allows the logging of input and output to separate files or all the[m
       one file. This version also supports a new timing file which records additional information. The command [1mscriptreplay --summary[0m[m
       then provides all the information.[m
[m
       If the argument [4mfile[24m or option [1m--log-out [4m[22mfile[24m is given, [1mscript [22msaves the dialogue in this [4mfile[24m. If no filename is given, the[m
       dialogue is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.[m
[m
       Note that logging input using [1m--log-in [22mor [1m--log-io [22mmay record security-sensitive information as the log file contains all[m
       terminal session input (e.g., passwords) independently of the terminal echo flag setting.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       Below, the [4msize[24m argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB,[m
       PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB"), or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB[m
       (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.[m
